                <p>It’s really the people that make Digits Experts the kind of company it is. We hire people who are smart and determined, and we favor ability over experience. Although Dexperts share common goals and visions for the company, we are differenet people with different background working for a common goal. And when not at work, dexperts pursue different interests ranging from cycling to beekeeping, dancing to painting.</p>
                <p> We strive to maintain the open culture often associated with startups, in which everyone is a hands-on contributor and feels comfortable sharing ideas and opinions. In our weekly meetings—not to mention over email or in the cafe—Dexperts ask questions directly to the management and other execs about any number of company issues. </p>

We’re looking for our next guy - someone who’s good for the role, good for Digits Experts and good at lots of things.
Things move quickly around here. That means we have to be lissom, both in how we work and how we hire. We look for people who are great at lots of things, love big challenges and welcome big changes. We can’t have too many specialists in just one particular area. We’re looking for people who are good for Digits Experts—and not just for right now, but for the long term.
</p>
<p>
Our process is pretty basic; the path to getting hired usually involves a first conversation with a recruiter, a phone interview and an onsite interview at our office. But there are a few things we've baked in along the way that make getting hired at Digits Experts a little different. 
</p>
<h4>
How we interview
</h4>
<p>
We’re looking for smart, team-oriented people who can get things done. When you interview at Digits Experts, you’ll likely interview with four or five Dexperts. They’re looking for four things: 
</p>
<h4>
Leadership
</h4>
<p>
We’ll want to know how you’ve flexed different muscles in different situations in order to mobilize a team. This might be by asserting a leadership role at work or with an organization, or by helping a team succeed when you weren’t officially appointed as the leader.
</p>
<h4>
Role-Related Knowledge
</h4>
<p>
We’re looking for people who have a variety of strengths and passions, not just isolated skill sets. We also want to make sure that you have the experience and the background that will set you up for success in your role. For engineering candidates in particular, we’ll be looking to check out your coding skills and technical areas of expertise.
</p>
<h4>
How You Think
</h4>
<p>
We’re less concerned about grades and transcripts and more interested in how you think. We’re likely to ask you some role-related questions that provide insight into how you solve problems. Show us how you would tackle the problem presented--don’t get hung up on nailing the “right” answer.
</p>
<h4>
Dexpertness
</h4>
<p>
We want to get a feel for what makes you, well, you. We also want to make sure this is a place you’ll thrive, so we’ll be looking for signs around your comfort with ambiguity, your bias to action and your collaborative nature. 
</p>
<h4>
How we decide
</h4>
<p>
There are also a few other things we do to make sure we’re always hiring the right candidate for the right role and for Digits Experts.
</p>
<p>
We believe that if you hire great people and involve them intensively in the hiring process, you’ll get more great people. Over the past couple of years, we’ve spent a lot of time making our hiring process as efficient as possible - reducing time-to-hire and increasing our communications to candidates. While involving Dexperts in our process does take longer, we believe it’s worth it. 
These core principles are true across Digits Experts, but when it comes to specifics, there are some pieces of our process that look a little different across teams. Our recruiters can help you navigate through these as the time comes.
At Digits Experts, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products and our community. Digits Experts is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer.
